# sigrok-Zero1-Decoder
A SigRok decoder for the Hornby Zero1 train Command Control system (pre dates DCC)

There is still a notable following and user base for the Hornby Zero1 Digital 
Command Control system from the 1970's so I have written this decoder to let you see what
is going on at the track level.

You will need suitable hardware to capture the data but DO NOT just connect the track to your
low buck logic analyser hardware the track is at +/- 22 volts and your 5v or 3v3 inputs won't
like that much.

I will publish how I did the hardware catpure once I have finished the decoder.
